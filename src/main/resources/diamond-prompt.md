Create a standalone Java application in the package co.instil.ryana.diamonds.

Your application is a console application that draws diamonds.

The application should prompt the user for a diamond height.

Heights cannot be even numbered. If there is an invalid input from the user (e.g. something that's not a number or not an even number) then the application should simply prompt again.

If the user enters "quit" then the application should exit.

Here are some example diamonds:

height: 3
```
 #
###
 #
```

height: 5

```
  #
 ###
#####
 ###
  #
```

This kata has some rules.

1. No function or method should be more than 10 lines
2. No function or method should have more than 3 levels of indentation
3. The code should not use any abbreviations or single letter variables
