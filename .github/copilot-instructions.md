This is a Java project for completing code katas.

When generating code ignore any Java files that are not in the same package as the
code being generated. 

Do not implement any feature that is not explicitly requested - even if there is
incomplete behaviour do not make it work unless requested.

Always generate behaviour describing tests using JUnit 5 in the test sources root.
Ignore any test code not in the same package as the package of the feature being
implemented. Even if not explictly requested in the prompt, you should generate
appropriate tests.
